I am a 1st year Master's student in Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park. I work audio-visual understanding at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) and [PIRL](http://www.pirl.umd.edu/) lab under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Ramani Duraiswami](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~ramanid/)

I completed my undergrad from IIT Madras where I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Umesh](https://speech-lab-iitm.github.io/) at the [SPRING Lab](https://asr.iitm.ac.in/) on multilingual ASR systems for Indian languages. I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Hema Murthy](https://bhashini.gov.in/) on the [Bhashini Project](https://bhashini.gov.in/) in collaboration with the Govt. of India.

After my undergrad I've worked as a Member of Technical Staff at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) working on various edge-computing solutions and integrating them into the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/). In the meanwhile I've also collaborated with students from University of Wisconsin Madision on understanding the Cooperative reasoning capabilities of LLMs through the [Hanabi](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) game
